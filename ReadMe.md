# AllDay DJ

Radio playout for the modern, cloud-driven world. This is the API for AllDay DJ, handing media storage, logs, VT, etc.

## Project Plan

The plan for delivering AllDay DJ in stages:

 - [ ] JWT auth integration.
 - [ ] Audio library (can store and edit carts).
 - [ ] Search
 - [ ] Log editing.
 - [ ] VT.
 - [ ] Scheduling.
 - [ ] Audio playout.

Some of these are absolute beasts (i.e. not a simple feature). Nice to have some ambition though!
